How to Use

This is used for keeping track of all your games.

After signup, please feel free to create your own library of games that you have played. To be fair, not every game is going to be a great game, but you should put it in regardless for the sake of tracking every game you have played. 


Additional info:

When you edit a game comment it will show your previous comment in top to bottom succession.
If you have any issues please contact me through github and I will fix anything that comes up.

Thank You for checking out my project!
